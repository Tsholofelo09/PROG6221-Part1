RecipeApp


Description
RecipeApp is a command-line application written in C# that allows users to create and manage recipes. Users can enter the details for each recipe, including the name, ingredients, and steps. The application provides functionality to display the recipe, scale the recipe by a factor, reset the quantities to the original values, and clear all the data to enter a new recipe. It also calculates and displays the total calories of the ingredients in a recipe and notifies the user when the total calories exceed 300. The software stores the data in memory during runtime and does not persist it between runs.
